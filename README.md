# Path-Finding-Visualizer
This project involved implementing various path-finding algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm, A* algorithm, and breadth-first search (BFS). 
Using Java's Swing or JavaFX libraries, I created an interactive GUI that allowed users to visualize the step-by-step process of finding the shortest path between two points on a grid or graph. The project also included user controls to set obstacles or barriers, select different algorithms, and adjust the speed of the visualization.
